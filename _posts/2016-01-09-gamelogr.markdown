Computer Science final year project.
GameLogr is an Android app which gets data about games from [IGDB](https://igdb.com){:target="_blank"}.
It's made with Java and uses an ondevice SQLite database to store all the users info so it can be accessed offline.


In the app you can add games to your library, wishlist or backlog to keep track of your games.
You can also see statistics over your collection, such as most commen genre or which console you have the most games for.
